00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:01.139
Here's going to happen.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.309
I am going to have to fix you,

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.630
manage you to on a more personal scale,

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:10.529
a more micro form of management.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.840
Jim,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.590
what is that called?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.149
Micro.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.840
Boom.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:13.430
Yes.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.470
Now Jim is going to be the client.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.040
Dwight,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.639
you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive,

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:20.350
hostile,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.590
or difficult.

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:22.309
Let's go.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.680
All right,

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:23.209
fine.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.020
Ring ring.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.559
Hello,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.909
hello,

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.260
this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:30.709
Well,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.139
that's great because I need paper.

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:33.060
Excellent,

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:37.119
then you are in luck because we are having a limited time offer only on everything.

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.470
Wow,

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:38.549
this is my lucky day.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.930
Ask him.

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:40.110
What is your name,

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.580
sir?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.790
I am Bill Butlicker.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.689
Really,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.560
that's your real name.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.540
How dare you?

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:48.779
My family built this country,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.220
by the way.

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.979
Be respectful,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.299
Dwight,

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.610
please.

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.900
Yes,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.340
Michael.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.099
Could you hold on one second.

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.900
That's my other line.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.340
What?

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.700
No,

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:54.209
but I,

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.779
hello.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.240
Yeah No,

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.319
I'm just on the phone with this stupid salesman.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.250
He's so dumb.

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:04.349
Probably just gonna keep them on the line forever and not buy anything.

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:06.208
OK,

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.829
it's up to you to change his mind.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.598
Sorry,

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:10.499
that was a family emergency.

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:10.999
Oh no,

00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:11.668
what's wrong?

00:01:11.848 --> 00:01:12.278
You know what?

00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:13.429
That's private.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:14.168
Boundaries,

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.569
Dwight.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.969
Come on,

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:15.698
I'm sorry,

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:15.929
Mr.

00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:16.488
Butlercker.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:17.439
As I was saying,

00:01:17.808 --> 00:01:19.598
we're having a limited a little bit louder.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:20.208
I'm hard of hearing.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.359
He's hard if he's an old man.

00:01:21.528 --> 00:01:21.808
OK,

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.369
as I was saying right now,

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:24.408
we are louder.

00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:24.768
OK,

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.249
our prices have never been low.

00:01:26.408 --> 00:01:26.448
So,

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:27.418
you have to talk louder.

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:28.399
Never been lower,

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.969
louder,

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:29.329
son.

00:01:29.528 --> 00:01:30.168
Butnecker.

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.249
Our prices have never been lower.

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:33.168
stop heat.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.709
That is totally inappropriate.

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:38.430
You should never yell at the client.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.730
Now you listen to me,

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:40.230
sir.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.989
Here we go.

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:44.279
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.199
hostile,

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.440
and definitely difficult.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.800
Please,

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:47.000
Mr.

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.250
Butler.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.279
I'm irate right now.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.809
Please give me another chance.

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:50.349
Give me the phone,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.480
Mr.

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:51.050
Butlicker,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.550
me the phone.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.000
I have to put you on with my boss.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.089
Well,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.029
I should hope so.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.959
Who is this?

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.279
Hello,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.400
this is Michael Scott,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.389
regional manager.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.599
Well,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.680
this is William M.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:59.459
Butlicker.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.930
Hello,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.110
Mr.

00:02:00.269 --> 00:02:00.760
Buttlicker.

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:01.720
How may we help you?

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.769
Michael,

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.980
I like the sound of your voice.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.980
You know what I'm gonna do?

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.540
I'm gonna buy $1 million worth of paper products today.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:10.529
See that's done.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.720
Thank you very much,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:12.199
sir.

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.720
I don't think you'll regret it.

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:14.160
I did.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.009
You are the master.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.809
There is one condition,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.169
Michael.

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.410
Yes,

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.100
you have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.570
Don't do it,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.929
Michael.

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:23.020
It's a million dollars sale.
